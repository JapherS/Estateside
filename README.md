## About Project  
The objective of the project was to make a property rental application that would allow users to interactively search properties in the selected area, inspect the different aspects associated with a property like the property type, amenities, parking etc. as well as express their interest in a particular property by contacting the associated property advertiser.  

## Problem Statement  
Two user types that would use this would be those who are looking for a rental (user/client) and those who are renting their unit (host/owner). On the user’s end, they would like to be able to search for properties whereas the owners would be notified of potential buyers.

## Proposed Solution  
Our proposed solution offers a realty web platform for users to browse available realty properties for rent and for sale. Users can search targeted properties and look up the details of the properties of interest. Additionally, the platform allows landlords and agents to update realty information (operations include adding new listings, deleting & modifying existing listings).    

## APIs used  
We are using Zillow’s public APIs. Zillow has a variety of apartment options to buy, sell and rent. The Web API endpoints return JSON metadata about the apartments located in a particular location based on REST principles. We will use the web API to provide search details based on various filters.
